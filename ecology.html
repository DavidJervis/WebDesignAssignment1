			<h3>Ecology</h3>
			<p>Most common features of our Campus life are Ash trees and Relic Hedgrows which provide food for over 40 insects and birds. Beech, Hawthorn and Line trees have signs of presence at our location once but they are rare to find in Corduff. The place is buzzing with life as multiple floras also provide food for small animals like rabbits and birds and off course they are rabbit burrows too. 
			
			Ivy is present in certain areas too and Lichens, another form of fungi/plant that is present within a radius. Off course to notice also we are surrounded by wetlands and drains, These features provide water and nutrient flow within the soil also. The current length of the campus is 22-24 hectares of land, most of it untouched and this leads to much growth. 
			
			Our campus also includes Dactylis, Festara and Knapweed. Usually found in wet areas, Fun Fact: The oldest tree on Campus is 112 years old by calculations. It is located beside the Bus Shelter.  </p>

	  	  <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
	  	  <p>Swans,Ducks and Geese all present at the front of the college. Rabbits, foxes, hedgehogs among others have also been discovered among the grounds as burrows are found and feces.There are many small insects also like ants and beetles that provide food for birds too. Occasionally there are bats and owls too but there is no evidence yet as the survey for the animals was conveyed during the day and in Winter season. With the high grasslands too there's so much coverage for aniamls against predators too and the forestry around help that too. Even the rabbits that are mentioned early are often see outside F Block graising on the green.</p>
